Note: I like to put the names after the SteamID list so it's easier to remember who is who in case I ever need to remove someone.
Example for SteamID's: 
local steamID_can_use_tracker = { "STEAM_0:0:27817023", "STEAM_0:0:63505098" } --pyro, skeleton

Example for User Groups: 
local group_can_use_tracker = { "righthand", "superadmin", "owner" }

steamID_can_use_tracker = { "STEAM_0:0:27817023" } --Put SteamID's here. Put them between quotes, and seperated by commas.
group_can_use_tracker = { "owner", "coowner"} --Put User Groups here. Put them between quotes, and seperated by commas.
